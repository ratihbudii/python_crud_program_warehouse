# Python CRUD Application for Pharmacy Clinic

A comprehensive Python application for managing Product Stock data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Business Understanding

This clinic operates a pharmacy unit with two main stakeholders: the clinic owner and the pharmacist. In 2023, the Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) introduced a new regulation that requires all clinics and similar healthcare facilities to report their operational data to a centralized national system, known as SatuSehat, with inventory data being one of the information that needs to be reported.

The current system used by the clinic relies on Microsoft Excel, thus, integrating it with the centralized system proves to be a challenge. Next to that, for administrative and statistics purposes, the ministry demands that the inventory data needs to be reported in accordance to the standards and qualities set by the ministry, being data completeness as one of those qualities.

Therefore, the clinicâ€™s pharmacy needs a warehouse management program that can be seamlessly integrated with SatuSehat, ensuring that medicine inventory data can be recorded and reported automatically as well as in compliance with the regulation. Python, as one of the prominent development platform, serves as a viable alternative for this purpose due to its flexibility and ability to implement integration and validation rules.

**Benefits:**

* One of the differentiators in the interface is input validation and error handling, which can improve data quality
* The implementation of product inventory using programs, rather than excel, also opens up the possibility of integration with other systems, e.g., databases or systems/APIs from the Ministry of Health

**Target Users:**

This application is designed for Pharmacy and Business Owner within the organization to facilitate their Task and Activities related to medicine product and medicine product stocks.
